A [serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication) library written in TypeScript for [Deno](https://deno.land) without any third party modules.

This library provides an interface for the communication with serial devices and **doesn't use any third party modules**. It uses C++ functions which are compiled to [WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly). These functions are then loaded by Deno to establish a serial connection and talk to the devices.

## Features
- Communication with serial devices.
- Create multiple serial connections at the same time.
- List available ports and their properties (if available).
- Set timeouts for both reading and writing.
- Async functions.
- Uses no third party modules.
- Works on multiple different operating systems (check [compatibility](#compatibility) for mor info).
